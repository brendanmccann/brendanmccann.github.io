			<h1>MICA GD Blog</h1>		
			
			<p>Most of the process was spent analyzing the classes that Ben setup and seeing how I could style them to fit what I thought the site needed. 
From interviewing other students I found that legibility was a large concern and that they wanted to do away with the current layout.</p> 

<p>Looking back on my approach I feel like I did not really accomplish what I hoped for the site as a whole. All of the pages are similiar in appearance so the experience is unified and feels connected. But they are so similiar that the different sections may not be easily distinguished.</p> 

<p>If I had the chance to re do the assignment I would focus on each page as a different experience rather than getting each to feel similiar.</p> 

<p>I do think that I got what I needed to learn out of this class. And that was learning how to learn. Before with writing code I would not know where to begin but now I am armed with resources that really explain in depth how things funtction and how to troubleshoot and deconstruct pages to learn from them.</p>
