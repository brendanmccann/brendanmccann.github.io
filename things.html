			<h1>Plural App.</h1>

			<p>Plural App organizes many different social media outlets and news sources into one easy to navigate site. The left sidebar pulls out to show links to each of the sources which you can customize. It then displays those websites contents in a clean easy to read format. I really like how everything can be streamlined into one site to log onto. I am however slightly weirded out about logging in to my accounts on this page but in theory it seems like a nice concept.</p>

			<p>Smithsonian has an awesome map of every page on the internet. Apparently each page is only 19 links away from each other. </p> 

			<h1>Crime Timeline</h1> 
			<a href="http://crimetimeline.io/"><img src="img/post5.png"></a> 

			<p>Crime timeline uses java script and user inputed data along with google maps to show crime in certain areas. Obviously being in baltimore this map can be pretty colorful.</p> 

			<h1> Feedly </h1> 
			<a href="https://feedly.com/i/explore/%23gaming"><img src=http://doktorspinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/feedly-logo11.jpg></a>

			<p>Audio sauna is an online synthesizer that allows anyone to make midid music within their browser. Software for doing this can cost upwards of 1000$ so making an open application like this is really cool to me. It runs on Java and flash. </p> 

			<h1> Drag and Throw Javascript</h1> 
			<a href="http://codepen.io/GreenSock/details/zDwEk"><img src="http://greensock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/example-draggable-throw-demo.jpg"></a>

			<p>Kaliedscope is a cool application that will analyze different types and versions of files and compare the differences between the two. It will let you know if you have duplicate files or your files are larger / smaller or the wrong size. Great for when you are working on multiple versions of a project and want to see everything that has changed from one interation to another.</p>  

			<h1>Bartender</h1> 
			<a href="http://www.macbartender.com/"><img src="http://macgroup.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bartender256.png"></a> 

			<p>Bartender is an application I started using recenlty to keep all of the processes running on my computer neatly organized into one small icon in the menu bar. Making for a cleaner UI as I am working. It's funny how the little things add up for me in terms of keeping things organized and tidy.</p>

Alowing this data to be used to find common intrest between communities.</p>
